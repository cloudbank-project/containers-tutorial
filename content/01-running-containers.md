## Getting started

### Opening a remote window

First things first, let's open VSCode and start a remote connection to our Linux cloud workstation (make sure it's turned on first). Start by clicking the blue `><` button in the corner:

![](../img/vs-remote-1.png)

From the menu that opens up, choose the option that mentions SSH:

![](../img/vs-remote-2.png)

And finally, select the VM that you've previously configured.

### Installing Docker

The process for installing Docker varies across operating systems. Since our VM is running Ubuntu Linux, we'll follow the official guide's [Linux instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository).

Start by opening a new terminal usin the terminal menu (`Terminal -> New Terminal`):

![new_terminal](../img/new_terminal.png)


In the terminal, we'll tell Linux where to find the Docker software we want to install. Run these commands:

```bash
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

Now, actually install Docker with this command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

Set up user permissions for running Docker with these commands:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

And finally, test that Docker was installed with this command:
```bash
docker --version
```

You should see some numbers get printed to the terminal, like this:

![](../img/docker-version.png)

Finally, reboot your VM by opening its dashboard in the Azure web portal and hitting the `Restart` button:

![](../img/vm-reboot.png)

## Pulling our first image

Now that everything has been set up, let's run a container! Run the following command:

```bash
docker pull hello-world
```

![pull](../img/pull.png)

The **pull** command has the syntax `docker pull [IMAGE NAME]` and downloads the specified image hosted on Docker Hub to your computer. In this case, we're pulling a very simple container image that will print a Hello World message to our terminal when we run it.

We can see all of the images downloaded to the computer with the command:

```bash
docker image list
```

![](../img/cli-image-list.png)

## Running our first container

Anyway, now that we've downloaded `hello-world`, let's run it. Try the following command in the terminal:

```bash
docker run --rm -it  hello-world
```

We'll see the output of the container appear in the terminal:

![run](../img/run.png)

Congratulations, you just ran your first container!

**ü§î So, what just happened? ü§î**

If containers are like little VMs, what happened to this one? Does it still exist? How did it print this text? Is it bored? Is it lonely?

When we **run** a container, the contents of the image are copied from disk into memory, and then the container's **entrypoint** is executed. The entrypoint is a terminal command, just like the ones we enter into the VS Code terminal. The only difference is that the command is executed from within the virtual world of the container, and it's specified ahead of time when the image was built. In this case, the entrypoint was a command that printed the "Hello from Docker!" message we see above.

After the entrypoint command completes, the container is **shut down** and its memory is freed. This means that all of the **changes to container files get wiped**; every time we run the container, it starts again from same the pristine state the image specifies.

{{% /aside %}}

### The `docker run` command in more detail

The docker **run** command takes this form:

```bash
docker run [flags] [image name]:[image version]
```

As we saw when "pulling", the image name is `hello-world`, and the version we downloaded was `latest` (this is the default version name, and if we didn't specify a version `latest` would be implied).

The `--rm` flag tells docker to delete the leftover contents of the container once it finishes running. Note that this doesn't delete the image -- it deletes the container we just ran, which was reconstituted from the image.

The `-it` flags tell docker to run the container interactively -- that is, use the terminal to print output and take input from us. Omitting this flag would run the container in the background without giving us an opportunity to prod it from the terminal. This is useful for containers that run web servers or train machine learning models, applications that might take a long time and not need user interactivity (at least, not interactivity through the terminal)


## Trying out a more interesting container

Now that we've gotten our sea legs, let's try running a container that does something more interesting. The `naclomi/textbook-writer` image contains a python script that uses rudimentary AI techniques to write machine-generated nonsense paragraphs for a materials science textbook. Here's a link to the container's page on Docker Hub:

üîó[https://hub.docker.com/r/naclomi/textbook-writer](https://hub.docker.com/r/naclomi/textbook-writer)
{{% /aside %}}

.

{{% aside %}}

 **üèÜ EXERCISE:** Use the commands we explored above to pull the image and then run it interactively. If you need reminders of the commands you've previously run, try using the **up and down arrow keys** at the terminal prompt to scroll through your command history.

Once you do so successfully, you should see some scientific-sounding garbage text printed to the console, looking something like this:

![run_2](../img/run_2.png)

{{% /aside %}}
  

## Exploring the internals

Let's next explore the virtual world of the textbook-writer's container, to get a sense of how it works. To do this we will explicitly change the entrypoint of the container from `main.py` (the textbook generation script) to `bash` (the **shell** program that lets us enter terminal commands). This deviates from the default usage pattern designed by author of the container image; we're effectively using a master key to climb into the container as the root user for a look around. The author will probably forgive us our curiosity ;) .

We can open a bash shell inside the container with the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint bash naclomi/textbook-writer
```

![bash](../img/bash.png)

Notice how the prompt has changed: we are now in a terminal within the container's virtual world, where our username is `root`, and the computer's name is `bda407f49990` (or some other arbitrary-looking name), and the current directory is `/usr/src/textbook-writer`. 

Let's take a look around. Run the `tree` command print the files within the current directory:

![tree](../img/tree.png)

Cool! We can see here that the non-gibberish real textbook that the machine-generated passages are based on is in the `data/` directory, and the entrypoint script is at `src/main.py`. Let's try running it from here:

```bash
python3 src/main.py
```

![run_internal](../img/run_internal.png)

And now let's look at the source code, by using the `cat` command to print the file to the terminal:

```bash
cat src/main.py
```

![source](../img/source.png)

Neato.

We can see that the script uses the library [markovify](https://pypi.org/project/markovify/) to generate random text. We didn't need to install this library ahead of time, because it came packaged inside the script's container. This is one of the main benefits of containeriazation!

To exit the virtual terminal, run the command `exit` or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+D`

## Entrypoint flags

If in the container we ran `python3 src/main.py -h`, we'd see that the python script takes some command line arguments of its own:

```bash
usage: main.py [-h] [--sentences N] [--pdf FILENAME]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help      show this help message and exit
  --sentences N   how many sentences to output
  --pdf FILENAME  output as a pdf file
```

Since `main.py` is the container's entrypoint, any flags we put in our `docker run` command following the image name will be passed to it.  Let's try playing with them. From the terminal:

```bash
docker run --rm -it naclomi/textbook-writer --sentences 1 
```

![run_3](../img/run_3.png)

We can use the `--pdf` flag to output the text as a pdf file, rather than terminal text:

```bash
docker run naclomi/textbook-writer --pdf textbook.pdf
```

![pdf1](../img/pdf1.png)

...but, how do we get the file *out* of the container?

## File mounts

By default, when a container finishes running all of the files generated or modified during its run are lost. However, we can **mount a directory** from our computer into the container's file system, inside of which any files created or modified will **persist** after the container shuts down.

Think of a file mount like a backpack: you can bring all of your study materials to the library, unpack them onto a table, and then do work. When you leave, you put everything back in your bag to carry out of the library, while at night anything you left on the table will get thrown out by the custodial staff.

To mount a directory to a container, we specify the mount point as a flag in our `docker run` command. The flag takes this form:

```bash
-v [host_path]:[container_path]
``` 

where `[host_path]` is the directory on your computer to mount, and `[container_path]` is the place inside the container it will show up. 

For our textbook writer, we can mount the current directory the terminal is sitting in to the container path `/output` with this command line (1):

```bash
docker run -v "${PWD}:/output" naclomi/textbook-writer --pdf /output/textbook.pdf
``` 

![pdf_output](../img/pdf_output.png)

Now if we look at the contents of the directory with the `ls` command, we'll see the PDF file:

```bash
ls
```

![](../img/vs-pdf-ls.png)

We can also open a graphical file browser with the command:

```bash
code -r .
```

From here, if we right-click the PDF file and select `Download`, we'll be able to save the file to our personal computer from the cloud:

![](../img/vs-pdf-download.png)

After doing that, try opening it up!

![pdf_yay](../img/pdf_yay.png)

Still just as incomprehensible as ever ;) .
